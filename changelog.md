## v1.0.1 / Mon, 29 Feb 2016
* Since K9 is actually a thing now, figured we should add an about command.

## v1.0.0 / Mon, 29 Feb 2016
* Yay! We made it to our first stable release!
* GIFs are awesome, so we added a Giphy module to make all your channels geferific (is that a word? I think we made up a word...)!
* Because sometimes it's too hard to look out the window... we've added a weather module!
* There's so many weird words out there... find their definitions with the new Urban Dictionary module!
* With so many modules available now, we thought it was high time you could load/unload them as you see fit.
* Some things should be private... so K9 now sends some things as private messages instead of public replies.
* Not ALL users are god, so we've split owner-only commands into their own module.

## v0.1.5 / Sun, 28 Feb 2016
* This shouldn't really have been a separate update, but we forgot to add it... oh well, first step towards making things modular!

## v0.1.4 / Sun, 28 Feb 2016
* Ever really hate your name? Well now you can change it!
* We're still learning, so lots of things are now done more intelligently than they were before (or so we think...)
* We have this nifty logging setup... only it didn't work. Now it does.
* K9 never really handled connections well... especially if you tried to make him connect to more than one server. Now he does that a bit better.
* Also... K9 can now be told to join servers on demand!

## v0.1.3 / Thu, 25 Feb 2016
* Know all those pesky little gremlins that find their way into code? Well now we handle them a bit better.
* When K9 replies to you, it now shows the pretty little typing indicator... because who doesn't love shinies?
* Up until now, K9 has been a bit shy. Now, the first (or next) time you run him, he'll introduce himself and help you setup an option or two!
* We all like getting our fortune told. Now K9 can tell yours with the !8ball command! (Really, he told us that we'd be releasing this update today!)

## v0.1.2 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Tiny little patch because we were stupid and forgot to update the readme

## v0.1.1 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* We know, we're going crazy with the updates today... but we just wanted to have a REAL milestone out ASAP! That milestone is NOW!
* We decided that a dog with only one trick was kinda lame... so we added `join`, `part/leave`, `afk`, and half a dozen different ways to tell K9 to shove off!
* If you REALLY want it, we added a tiny little shell script for those of you who are Node impaired (you still have to actually install the dependencies though).

## v0.1.0 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* This is a super special release! K9 learned his first trick! He finally learned how to play ping-pong!
* We thought you might like to know what we're working on... so we added this nifty changelog with retroactive deets for your reading pleasure!
* We tried, we really did. Unfortunately, we didn't learn enough lessons with 0.0.3 and had to make adjustments again. Now we're logging in smarter...er.

## v0.0.3 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Login smarter... not harder. We used to do silly things with usernames and passwords every time you started K9... now we don't! Yay for tokens!
* Fixed ALL the invite codes! K9 can now actually join a server... not just login to one he was already in.
* Evil gremlins snuck into our code and make the config save function merge all our configs into one... this was not ideal, so we excised them.

## v0.0.2 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Still can't really do anything... but CAN login!

## v0.0.1 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Woot! First release! Sadly, doesn't do anything yet though...
